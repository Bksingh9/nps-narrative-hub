- **crawlerRoutes.js**: API endpoints for CSV operations
- **In-memory data store**: Fast filtering without database queries

### Frontend Components
- **Upload.tsx**: Enhanced upload page with real-time filtering UI
- **csvDataService.ts**: Frontend service for API communication
- **Real-time updates**: Instant filter application without page reload

## Performance

- **Fast Processing**: In-memory data storage for instant filtering
- **Smart Caching**: Filter results cached for quick access
- **Efficient Updates**: Only filtered data transmitted to frontend
- **Scalable**: Handles thousands of records efficiently

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No data available" error**
   - Upload a CSV file first
   - Check if backend server is running on port 3001

2. **Columns not detected**
   - Ensure column names match supported variations
   - Check CSV file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)

3. **Date filtering not working**
   - Verify date format in CSV (ISO, US, or European formats supported)
   - Check date range selection in UI

4. **NPS scores incorrect**
   - Ensure scores are numeric values
   - Check if scale conversion is needed (0-100 ‚Üí 0-10)

## Next Steps

1. **Add more visualizations**: Charts for filtered data
2. **Batch processing**: Handle multiple CSV files
3. **Export templates**: Download filter configurations
4. **Scheduled imports**: Automatic CSV processing
5. **Data validation**: Enhanced error handling and validation
